#Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera
This repository contains the requirements to fulfill the Getting and Cleaning Data course.

#Contents
This repository contains:
- README.md- explains what this repository is about
- run_analysis.R- contains the script I used to clean the original dataset given  
- tidydata.txt- the tidy data set produced by the run_analysis script  
- codebook.md- explains the variables and the data in the tidydata.txt  

#Instructions
Unzip the source (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) into your desired folder. Set this folder as your working directory.

Use the run_analysis.R script to clean the original dataset. Replace the file paths to reflect your folder.


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
